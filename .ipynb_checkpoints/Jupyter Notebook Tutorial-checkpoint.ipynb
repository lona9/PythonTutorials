    "What is a Jupyter Notebook? For context, you're looking at one right now! A Jupyter Notebook is a web-application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. They're popularly used for data analysis and exploration, machine learning, visualization and much more. It supports many different languages, produces rich and interactive output and can be easily shared for others to see or even run on their own computers without too much hassle or implementation. We'll use Notebooks to teach YOU how to use them! Here you'll find the basics of how to use and format a Notebook, as well as some tips on how to make them pretty and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first! If you're seeing this as a repo and you're excited already about using them on your computer, we'll walk you through the installation process, after that you'll be able to run this same notebook and test every code cell you see here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "To get Jupyter Notebooks, we first need to install Anaconda, which is a program to manage packages and enviroments to use with Python. Anaconda is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. You can go to this <a href=\"https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual\">link</a> to download the installer, choose the Python 3.7 or higher version, and the appropriate 64/32-bit installer. If you already have Python installed on your computer, this won't break anything. Instead, the default Python used by your scripts and programs will be the one that comes with Anaconda. You can find further installation instructions <a href=\"https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/\">here</a>. \n",
    "After installation, you can check out your own install by entering ```conda list``` into your terminal, which will list all packages installed.\n",
    "To avoid errors in the future, you can run an upgrade on all packages installed with the following commands: ```conda upgrade conda``` and ```conda upgrade --all```. This usually solves many random issues you might get along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check/Install pip\n",
    "After that installation, ```pip``` should be installed automatically, and you can check so by typing ```pip --version```. If the command is not recognized, you need to install pip manually to be able to install packages via pip later on. You can install ```pip``` by typing the following command on your terminal: ```conda install pip```. After that process is over, you can check the version again to make sure everything is installed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: You might need to use pip3 instead, depending on the enviroment you're using and if you had installed different Python versions before Anaconda. If you get an error with pip, try pip3 and see if that works instead.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finally... Install Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "After Anaconda is ready, you'll have the Anaconda Navigator, which should include Jupyter Notebooks ready to use after just clicking on the icon. If you get an error saying something's missing, you might need to install it manually. You can take care of this by using ```pip install jupyter notebook```. After that process, you will be able to type ```jupyter notebook``` on your Conda terminal, and it will launch Jupyter Notebook on your default browser. "

Because you already installed Anaconda, which includes a lot of data science packages, you probably won't have to do much else other than, well, importing! But if you're using a fancy new package that's not included in Anaconda (you'll get an error when importing), you're gonna have to install it on your terminal using the pip command again. After it's installed, it's customary to keep all your imports on a single cell at the very start of your code. That way, you only run your imports once and then you can forget about it!<br> Let's do a quick import to show you how it works."

    "### Versioning and checkpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any coding, it's important to version your work and Notebooks are not the exception, specially considering you can't really undo certain changes, or because it's easy to get carried away coding, and if you're messy you might forget what the previous coding block was about and now you can't get an error to go away. Not worrying about that is easy if you follow a few simple steps to ensure you don't lose any of your precious work:\n",
    "- **You overwrote some code accidentally (or not so much) and you can't Ctrl-Z your way to the start?** Since no one's charging you per cell you create, it's best to test new implementations in new cells instead of writing a cell that's already been tested (this is particularly true if it's a bigger block of code). Since cells can run independently, you can copy+paste your original code on a new cell and then make changes and test them separately until you're sure and happy with the results, and only then, replace the original, to avoid losing important lines.\n",
    "- **You messed up pretty badly and need to go WAY back to a point in the past where you made better decisions.** You should use checkpoints regularly, at point where you're sure everything works just fine, or it's easy to pick up if you need to revert. You can do so using the Save button on the menu, and you can choose which checkpoint you want to revert your work to, going to File -> Revert to Checkpoint -> *Your desired timestamp*.\n",
    "- **You want to show your progress so far to other teammates or want to see what you did for another Notebook and don't remember where you put the file**. GitHub can render Notebooks pretty well, and will serve as a quick reference to see how you or others did X things for which you don't have the file at hand (or the shortcut to GitHub is just faster). You get versioning and good coding practices, and some green blocks for your GitHub profile!"
